## Funding
This project is funded by the Le [RÃ©seau Optique et Photonique du CNRS](https://rop.cnrs.fr/)

## Hosting
The project is hosted at https://alexandrix.com/fopti

## Installation
Just download the code ZIP file and open index.html in your favorite browser, preferably Firefox or Chrome.

## Configuration
If you wish to amplify or diminish input signal on your personal implementation of FOPTI, you can change the value of the *myVerySpecialInputScaling* variable at line 8 of the script file *js/main.js*.

You can also enable a high contrast black & white mode by setting the *highContrastMode* variable to *true* at line 9.

## Future evolutions
- Flow mode on Timefreq view instead of radar
- Export recorded data with a Save button
