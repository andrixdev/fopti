# fopti
Enhanced Michelson interferometer for a sensory understanding of gravitational wave detectors

![FOPTI User Interface](img/fopti-preview.jpg?raw=true "FOPTI UI")

## Funding
This project is funded by the Le [RÃ©seau Optique et Photonique du CNRS](https://rop.cnrs.fr/)

## Hosting
The projet is hosted at https://alexandrix.com/fopti

## Configuration
If you wish to amplify or disminish input signal on your personal implementation of FOPTI, you can change the value of the *myVerySpecialInputScaling* variable at line 8 of the script file *js/main.js*.


## Validation pending
- Add calibration multiplicative factor for input signal, with howto indications in README.md  
- Add controls for vertical and horizontal scales (oscilloscope)

## Remaining tasks
- Add controls for vertical and horizontal scales (timefreq & combined)  
- Clean up timefreq graph visually overflowing data  
- Trying full refresh and full data flow on Timefreq view
